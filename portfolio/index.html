        <h1>p5.js Audio Visualizer</h1>
        <p>Meant for desktop, this audio visualizer has three methods of demonstrating frequency and amplitude. There is a preloaded song list, or the user can drag and drop any audio file to play it.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:.75em; margin-left:-13%;">Allow for loading.</span></p>

        <h1>p5.js Color Picker</h1>
        <p>Meant for desktop, this sketch loads a JSON file, and randomly places dots. Mousing over these dots shows the color names, as well as similar colors. Pressing up or down on a keyboard will lighten or darken the background.</p>

        <h1>p5.js Audio Visualizer (#2)</h1>
        <p>This desktop only visualizer focuses on showing music in a way that mimics the vibrant album art of the preloaded songs. Because of keyboard commands, this can't be used on mobile at the moment.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:.75em; margin-left:-13%;">Allow for loading.</span></p>

        <h1>p5.js Sound Experiment</h1>
        <p>Created for my Audio Foundations class, this project experimented with sound by loading multiple music files that could be played simultaniously, and a pitch slider.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:.75em; margin-left:-13%;">Allow for loading.</span></p>

          <h1>Wednesday</h1>
          <p>This is a digitally drawn sketch of my friend's cat, Wednesday. I was inspired by a photo of her mischivously peering out from under a bed. I made this to use as a small emote, hence the lack of a body and detail.</p>
